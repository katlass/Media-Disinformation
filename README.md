## Data Visualization Exploring Media Disinformation, Including Interactive Javascript

In this project we examine psychometric dimensions associated with
political orientation and susceptibility to disinformation. <br>
The data was obtained from an academic study conducted by researchers at the California State University
San Marcos, and contains 247 observations across two study conditions of 53
variables, including gender, political affiliation, time spent reading news headlines
presented by researchers, among others.<br>
We seek to illustrate findings presented previously by researchers in text-heavy
scholarly publications. By doing so, we expect to contribute to the outreach of
research in a topic that has critical implications in contemporary society.<br>

We provide an R bookdown presentation including data exploration using ggplot2 and an interactive JavaScript component created using the D3.js library: https://katlass.github.io/media_disinformation/interactive-component.html <br>

Description:
In this project we will be examining what sort of people View like and share disinformation on a major social media site, Facebook. In this case the participants saw three different disinformation items and were asked a number of questions related to their likeliness of sharing, extraversion and many other attributes. Through this we are hoping to discover patterns and trends amongst people most and least influenced by this information.
